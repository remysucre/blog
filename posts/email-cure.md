# Filter Every Mail: a Cure for Email Addiction

Years ago I purged social media from my life, 
 and I never looked back.
I could not afford to quit email though,
 so I turned off the notification,
 only to find myself compulsively checking
 my inbox every 15 minutes.
This week, I finally found a simple cure
 for my email addiction:
 filter every mail.

It's as easy as it sounds:
I set up a filter to have every single mail
 skip the inbox, so my inbox is always empty.
Inbox zero by construction!
One way to do this in Gmail is to create a filter
 for any message larger than 0MB.

Some benefits of this method:
1. It needs no plugins.
2. It works on the web, email clients, and mobile apps.
3. When I need to find information from past emails, I can still log in without seeing new messages. 

The third point is very important: 
 before this I have tried logging out, 
 using blockers, 
 or turning off sync from my email client, 
 but sometimes I just need to look up this link
 that someone sent me either yesterday or a minute ago.
Now I can just do my searching without getting
 jabbed by dopamine.

I still need to actually check for new mails though,
 but I have enough self control to check "all mails" 
 only once every couple days.
